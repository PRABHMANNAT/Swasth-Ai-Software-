  {
    question: "What is Swasth AI?",
    answer:
      "Swasth AI is an all-in-one healthcare platform that combines a mobile app with 32+ health management tools and DoseGuard - a wearable micro-dosing patch. It unifies your medical records, computes an AI-powered Health Score from your blood reports, lets you consult an AI doctor, book appointments, and manage your family's health from a single interface.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is DoseGuard?",
    answer:
      "DoseGuard is a wearable patch that monitors your vitals (heart rate, SpO2, temperature, motion) in real-time using bio-sensors, and delivers medication in precise micro-doses only when your body's signals indicate a need. It replaces fixed-schedule dosing with intelligent, body-responsive drug delivery.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is DoseGuard safe?",
    answer:
      "Safety is the core design principle. DoseGuard operates with a hard safety envelope: maximum dose limits per hour, mandatory cooldown periods, and a fail-safe rule - if any sensor faults are detected, the pump shuts off immediately. Every dose is logged with a reason and sent to the doctor's dashboard. Multi-sensor fusion prevents false triggers from any single sensor.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is my AI Health Score calculated?",
    answer:
      "When you upload a blood report, our AI extracts 80+ physiological parameters - covering thyroid function, kidney function, liver health, vitamins, cholesterol, blood counts, and more. Each parameter is analyzed against clinical reference ranges, scored individually, and aggregated into a single Health Score out of 100.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my medical data secure?",
    answer:
      "Yes. All data is encrypted with AES-256 at rest and in transit via TLS 1.3. Authentication uses OAuth 2.0/OIDC. The platform is designed to be ABDM/FHIR compliant. Your records are only accessible to you, and you control who sees them.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use Swasth AI for my family?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. The Family Health Management feature lets you manage medical records, Health Scores, and appointments for up to 5 family members from a single account. Switch between profiles in one tap.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the AI Doctor work?",
    answer:
      "The AI Doctor uses open-source medical LLMs trained on government-approved medical databases. It provides symptom analysis, medication guidance, and personalized recommendations. For complex cases, it connects you to nearby verified doctors for real-time consultation. It's an AI-first triage layer - not a replacement for your physician.",
  },
  {
    question: "What conditions does Swasth AI support?",
    answer:
      "The platform is designed primarily for chronic condition management - diabetes, hypertension, thyroid disorders - but the Health Score and medical repository work for any patient. DoseGuard's drug cartridge system is designed to be modular, supporting different medications through swappable cartridges.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Swasth AI available on iOS and Android?",
    answer:
      "The Swasth AI app is built with React Native and will be available on both iOS and Android. Early access is currently open for Android users in India.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you have published research?",
    answer:
      'Yes. Our research paper - "Swasth AI: Unifying India\'s Fragmented Healthcare System Through AI-Powered Diagnostics and Model Fusion" - is published in IEEE ACROSET 2025 and indexed in Scopus. You can read it at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11280738.',
  },
  {
    question: "Is this just a concept or a working product?",
    answer:
      "Both the software and hardware are functional. The Swasth AI app has 32+ live features. The DoseGuard patch has been 3D-printed, sensor-tested, and has a working micro-pump with verified dose accuracy within 10% and trigger-to-dose response under 5 seconds.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is Swasth AI different from Practo, 1mg, or PharmEasy?",
    answer:
      "Those platforms solve individual problems - booking, pharmacy, or teleconsultation. Swasth AI is a unified platform that combines medical records, AI health scoring, doctor consultation, appointment booking, 32+ health tools, family management, and a hardware wearable for intelligent drug delivery. No other platform in India connects your complete history to real-time body signals to drive treatment decisions.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the business model?",
    answer:
      "Freemium. Basic features (records, basic Health Score, AI chat, booking, reminders) are free. Premium unlocks the full suite - advanced analytics, PDF chat, family management, personalized plans, and all 32+ tools. We also offer enterprise plans for hospitals and clinics with provider dashboards and API access.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are you looking for investment or partnerships?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We're actively seeking partnerships with hospitals, diagnostic chains, insurance providers, and government health programs. For investment inquiries, please reach out via our contact form or email us at contact@swasthai.com.",
